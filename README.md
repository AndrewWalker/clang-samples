# Clang Library Examples

A collection of samples for using Clang, with the infrastructure (and idea)
borrowed from Eli Bendersky's
[llvm-clang-samples](https://github.com/eliben/llvm-clang-samples) repository.

The intent here is to providea micro testbed for ideas in C++ before
demonstrating the equivalent behavior in Python using
[clast](https://github.com/AndrewWalker/clast).

The code presented here is has been compiled against the version 3.9 of clang
and LLVM in the apt repositories (clang version 3.9.0-svn267343-1~exp1)
